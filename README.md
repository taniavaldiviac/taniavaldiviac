# About Me:

Hi there! 

<br>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Centro de Investigaciones BiolÃ³gicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR), Mexico, where I conduct interdisciplinary research in molecular ecology, seascape genomics, and conservation. My work spans from eukaryotes to marine mammals, integrating population genomics and modeling tools to evaluate marine ecosystems' structural and functional connectivity and understand the spatial and temporal patterns that shape biodiversity.<br><br>Currently, I focus on developing and implementing environmental DNA (eDNA) tools, including metabarcoding, qPCR, and ddPCR, for the detection and monitoring of key marine species, such as *Phocoena sinus* (vaquita porpoise) and *Totoaba macdonaldi*, with applications in conservation and fisheries management. <br><br>I have collaborated with national and international interdisciplinary groups, contributing to innovative strategies for marine biodiversity monitoring.<br><br>ðŸ”¬ Passionate about marine conservation, genomics, and cutting-edge molecular tools<br>ðŸŒŠ Exploring the intersection of genetic connectivity, seascape ecology, and environmental change<br>ðŸ“Š Integrating bioinformatics, modeling, and eDNA-based approaches for biodiversity monitoring<br><br>Letâ€™s connect and collaborate! ðŸš€
